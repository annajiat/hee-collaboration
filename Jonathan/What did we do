we edited each other's files. 
We saw that you can't all make changes at the same time
We created new directories by adding a slash as we created a new file
We made someone else a collaborator - and saw why email is better than a username at identifying someone new
We used a bit of html to make different font sizes

Annajiat created a repo without giving rights for us to change things, so we could see what happens when we try editing someone else's files
So we created pull requests. And viewed what happens
